# Telcoin Network Smart Contracts

## TANIP-1 Telcoin Application Network Issuance Program

This repository currently houses the `TANIssuanceHistory` smart contract used for distributing and recording rewards to TEL stakers participating in the TANIP-1 referral program. It is located in `src/issuance/TANIssuanceHistory.sol` and its tests are located in both `test/issuance/TANIssuanceHistoryTest.t.sol` and `test/issuance/TANIssuanceHistoryForkTest.t.sol`

For auditors, please refer to the readme at `src/issuance/README.md`. For those looking to find more generalized information about this program, please refer to [the backend (offchain) calculator repository](https://github.com/Telcoin-Association/telcoin-laboratories-contracts) which calculates the rewards to build accounts & rewards calldata for settlement on the `TANIssuanceHistory` contract.

As TANIP-1 is not strictly a Telcoin-Network program, this smart contract will be eventually moved to the [Telcoin labs repository](https://github.com/Telcoin-Association/telcoin-laboratories-contracts)

## ConsensusRegistry

### Role

The Telcoin Network ConsensusRegistry contract serves as a single onchain source of truth for consensus-related items which need to be easily accessible across all TN nodes.

These items include

1.  **ConsensusNFT Whitelist** To onboard, new validators must obtain a `ConsensusNFT` through Telcoin governance. The ConsensusRegistry contract manages this NFT ledger.
2.  Managing TEL staking mechanisms, such as locking stake for governance-approved validators as well as tracking and distributing (pull-based) rewards for validation services
3.  Managing the active validator set, autonomously bringing them through pending queues for activation and exit
4.  Storing historical epoch information which includes epoch block heights and voting validator committees. Voter committees are predetermined by the protocol and stored two epochs in the future.

To keep this information up to date, the protocol maintains contract state via the use of a system call to `ConsensusRegistry::concludeEpoch()` at the end of each epoch. This action is what kickstarts the beginning of each new epoch.

### Mechanisms

#### The contract's most frequent entrypoint: `concludeEpoch()`

- **Finalize Epoch:** The `concludeEpoch` function is responsible for finalizing the previous epoch, updating the validator set, storing new epoch information, and incrementing staking rewards. Rewards may then be claimed by validators at their discretion.
- **System Call Context** `concludeEpoch()` may only be called by the client via `system call`, which occurs every epoch. This logic is abstracted into the `SystemCallable` module.

#### ConsensusNFT Whitelist

To join Telcoin Network as a validator, node operators first must be approved by Telcoin governance. Once approved, validators will be issued a `ConsensusNFT` serving as a permissioned validator whitelist. Only the contract owner, an address managed by Telcoin governance, can issue these NFTs via `ConsensusRegistry::mint()`

The ERC721 `tokenId` of each validator's token corresponds to their validator uid, termed `validatorIndex` in the registry's implementation.

#### Validator Registration and Staking

Once issued a `ConsensusNFT`, validators may enter the pending activation queue at their discretion by staking a fixed amount of native TEL and providing their public keys via `ConsensusRegistry::stake()`

Below, we follow the general lifecycle of a new validator in roughly chronological order.

1. **Validator Registration**

   - **Stake:** Validators with a `ConsensusNFT` call the `stake()` function along with the required stake amount, providing their BLS public key, BLS signature, and ED25519 public key.
   - **Pending Activation:** Upon successful staking, the validator's status is set to `PendingActivation`, and its activation epoch is recorded to be 2 epochs in the future. After awaiting the remainder of the current epoch and then one full epoch, its status will automatically be updated to `Active`

2. **Activation**

   - **Epoch Advancement:** At the end of each epoch, the `concludeEpoch()` function is system called directly from the client. This function automatically processes the `PendingActivation` and `PendingExit` queues. Thus, validators in the `PendingActivation` (or `PendingExit`) state are set to `Active` (or `Exited`) state if their activation (or exit) epoch has been reached by advancing an epoch.

3. **Reversible Exit**

   - **Exit Requests** Once active, validators may call the `exit()` function to initiate an exit from the network. These exits are reversible and may be used for node maintenance or key rotation. To permanently forgoe validator status, exited validators must then reclaim their stake and burn their ConsensusNFT using `unstake()`
   - **Pending Exit** Upon calling `exit()`, the validator's status is set to `PendingExit`, and their exit epoch is recorded to be 2 epochs in the future. The pending queue is handled identically to the `PendingActivation` process described above.

4. **Rejoining**

   - **Rejoin Requests** Once exited, validators may call the `rejoin()` function to initiate a rejoin request. They may provide new keys if desired.
   - **Pending Activation** Upon calling `rejoin()`, the validator will be entered into the `PendingActivation` queue

5. **Unstaking**
   - **Withdraw Stake:** Once in the `Exited` state, validators can call the `unstake` function to withdraw their original stake amount along with any accrued rewards.
   - Once unstaked, a validator can no longer `rejoin()`, as their `ConsensusNFT` is burned and their validator is set to `UNSTAKED` state, which is unrecoverable. Should an unstaked validator want to resume validating the network, they must reapply to Telcoin governance and be re-issued a new `ConsensusNFT`

### ConsensusRegistry storage layout for genesis

The registry contract uses explicit namespaced storage to sandbox sensitive state by category and prevent potential overwrites during upgrades (it is an upgradeable proxy for testnet +devnet). Namespaced sections are separated by "---" blocks

#### Storage locations for dynamic variables

- `stakeInfo` content (s) is derived using `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(bytes32(keyAddr), stakeInfo.slot))`
- `epochInfo` (x) begins at slot `0xaf33537d204b7c8488a91ad2a40f2c043712bad394401b7dd7bd4cb801f23101` and spans four static array members through slot `0xaf33537d204b7c8488a91ad2a40f2c043712bad394401b7dd7bd4cb801f23108`
- `futureEpochInfo` (y) begins at slot `0xaf33537d204b7c8488a91ad2a40f2c043712bad394401b7dd7bd4cb801f23109` and spans four static array members through slot `0xaf33537d204b7c8488a91ad2a40f2c043712bad394401b7dd7bd4cb801f2310c`
- `validators` (z) begins at slot `0x8127b3d06d1bc4fc33994fe62c6bb5ac3963bb2d1bcb96f34a40e1bdc5624a27` and spans slots equal to 3x the total number of validators, because each `ValidatorInfo` member occupies 3 slots. It is worth noting that the first three slots belong to an undefined and unused validator with `validatorIndex == 0`

## RWTEL Module

### Role

The Recoverable Wrapped Telcoin (rwTEL) contract serves as TN's bridge architecture entry and exit point with respect to execution. In simpler terms, this module performs the actual delivery of inbound $TEL from Ethereum ("ethTEL") and exports outbound $TEL ("TEL") which has been settled by waiting out the RecoverableWrapper's timelock.

### Design Decisions

RWTEL.sol combines Circle Research's recoverable wrapper utility with the required Axelar parent contract, `AxelarGMPExecutable`, which provides the bridge setup's execution interface `_execute()` that must be implemented to support Axelar bridge infrastructure as it will be called by the Axelar gateway.

Rather than revert execution of failing bridge transfers, `_execute()` emits an `ExecutionFailed` event. This is inspired by ERC4337's handling of failed UserOperations and ensures that failed bridge transfers don't reach an invalid state where the message is marked as `BaseAxelarAmplifierGateway::MESSAGE_APPROVED` but can never be executed to reach `BaseAxelarAmplifierGateway::MESSAGE_EXECUTED`. Such a state would only confuse relayers watching these states who might repeatedly try to re-execute failures.

Instead, bridge transfers that fail execution on the destination chain will emit `ExecutionFailed` and still be marked as executed even when the destination address rejects a native TEL transfer. The onus is then on the user/bridger to resubmit a valid, non-reverting bridge transfer on the source chain that succeeds.

It is important to note that this type of execution failure will be exceedingly rare, resulting only from invalid transactions such as attempting to send $TEL to a non-payable contract which rejects native tokens.

### Mechanisms

As a reminder, the only way to obtain TEL on Telcoin-Network is via bridging. The high-level concept of secure TN bridging for a TEL holder pre-genesis is:

- **A.** Own the $TEL ERC20 on Ethereum (which we have been calling "ethTEL")
- **B.** Perform an ERC20 spend approval for the Axelar External Gateway
- **C.** Submit a bridge message to Axelar Network for verification by locking ethTEL in the Axelar external gateway on Ethereum

Because ethTEL is the canonical $TEL token which will be used as native currency on TN (in the form of TEL), a way for incoming ethTEL ERC20 tokens to be converted to a non-ERC20 base layer currency must be implemented at the bridge entrypoint. This is one primary function of the RWTEL module.

Without this functionality, incoming ethTEL from Ethereum mainnet would be delivered as the ERC20 wTEL and cannot be unwrapped to native TEL without already having some to pay gas. In such a scenario, no entity would even be able to transact on TN as there would be no currency to pay gas with.

### TEL Minted at Genesis

The total supply of ethTEL is "minted" to the RWTEL module as native TEL at genesis, and exists there but cannot be accessed by anyone in any way other than bridging from Ethereum.

The locked status of tokens on Ethereum must be independently verified by a quorum of Axelar verifiers before that bridge request can be carried out on TN.

- While the total supply of TEL native currency exists from network genesis, it is locked in the RWTEL module and can only be unlocked when a corresponding amount of ethTEL ERC20 token is locked in the bridge gateway contract on Ethereum. This binary relationship of lock <> release state between chains is what maintain's the token supply's integrity.
- **Security Posture:** Achieving security is sandboxed to the two usual smart contract security concepts: ECDSA integrity and upgradeability. In this case rogue access to TEL without bridging is infeasible unless brute forcing a private key for the RWTEL address or performing a malicious upgrade. Thus security considerations are:
  - **A.** ECDSA integrity of RWTEL (brute force its private key, probabilistically impossible)
  - **B.** Exploitation of the RWTEL module's upgradeability (steal private keys for the multisig owner)
